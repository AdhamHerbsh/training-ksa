    "p": "King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) started as a pioneering idea that became a reality. This idea was adopted by King Fahad bin Abdulaziz — may he rest in peace — and the foundation stone was laid by Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz in 1403 AH, corresponding to 1983 AD. The city began its operations during the reign of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahad bin Abdulaziz, and it was officially inaugurated by King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz — who was then Crown Prince — on 21/08/1425 AH, corresponding to 05/10/2004 AD. KFMC is strategically located in the heart of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. It is one of the largest and fastest-growing medical complexes in the Middle East, with a capacity of 1,200 beds. It includes a highly qualified and professional administrative and technical team, all working toward one goal: making KFMC a medical reference center to which patients are referred from all over the region and at all stages of treatment. The city brings together medical and professional competencies from various specialties to provide the best care for more than 30,000 inpatients and 500,000 outpatients annually. Due to the qualified staff in the work environment at KFMC, it provides high-quality healthcare with full commitment to excellence in patient care. The city also seeks to achieve one of its most important priorities, which is the dissemination of knowledge and the promotion of a culture of development and achievement in the community."

                    King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) started as a pioneering idea that became a reality. This idea was
                    adopted by King Fahad bin Abdulaziz — may he rest in peace — and the foundation stone was laid by
                    Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz in 1403 AH, corresponding to 1983 AD.

                    The city began its operations during the reign of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahad
                    bin Abdulaziz, and it was officially inaugurated by King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz — who was then Crown
                    Prince — on 21/08/1425 AH, corresponding to 05/10/2004 AD.

                    KFMC is strategically located in the heart of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. It is one of the
                    largest and fastest-growing medical complexes in the Middle East, with a capacity of 1,200 beds. It
                    includes a highly qualified and professional administrative and technical team, all working toward
                    one goal: making KFMC a medical reference center to which patients are referred from all over the
                    region and at all stages of treatment.

                    The city brings together medical and professional competencies from various specialties to provide
                    the best care for more than 30,000 inpatients and 500,000 outpatients annually.

                    Due to the qualified staff in the work environment at KFMC, it provides high-quality healthcare with
                    full commitment to excellence in patient care. The city also seeks to achieve one of its most
                    important priorities, which is the dissemination of knowledge and the promotion of a culture of
                    development and achievement in the community.
